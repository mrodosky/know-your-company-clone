Know Your Company Clone

This multi-tenant app is my attempt to replicate, on a very basic level, the functionality of the Know Your Company system (knowyourcompany.com). I have only focussed on the backend and completely ignored the front-end and UI for now. That being said, my Rails app does generate a very very basic front-end (forms for adding users, adding and answering questions, simple text-based emails etc with no styles whatsoever).

The following links helped me come up with the architecture for the app:

The app also lives at: http://knowyourcompany-clone.herokuapp.com

Contact me if you want to try it out. Feel free to fork and work on it as well.

* Ruby version: 2.1.0
* Rails verion: 4.1.4

Some Caveats:

1. Apart from the basic nature of the app, it is completely untested (of course I manually tested locally and on Heroku, but no automated tests are in place). You can consider this a spike that I've just gotten through over the past couple of days in my spare time. If I were to continue developing this app, I would write tests for everything I have so far, and then start to add/refactor
